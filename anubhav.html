<h1>NEURALINK AND AI-FUTURE OF HUMANITY</h1>
<p><em>This is our  project based on the  idea of Elon Musk Neuralink .<br> Our project tells about the advantages and the features that can be ground-<br> breaking using  Neuralink . We want to spread awareness about it and<br> explore more about the exciting future of Humanity using Neuralink And AI.</em></p>

        <h3>ABOUT NEURALINK</h3>
        <p><em>Neuralink says they have developed a robot capable of rapidly inserting many flexible probes into the brain, which may avoid the problems of tissue damage and longevity associated with larger and more rigid probes. This robot has an insertion head with a 40 μm diameter needle made of tungsten-rhenium designed to attach to the insertion loops, made to transport and insert individual probes, and to penetrate the meninges and tissue cerebral. The robot is capable of inserting up to six wires (192 electrodes) per minute.It could also be used as a connection between the technology and humans. 
          The world would be greatly ordered in case Elon Musk succeeds in this venture. Many patients hit by paralysis have also reached out to him asking him to use them as a subject of his study but Musk insists on first using it on monkeys. The people with paralysis may benefit by easily operating their phones directly through their brains. 
          It can also be used to draw pictures, take photographs etc. 
          This technology can be a breakthrough for various neuro disease patients and also brain disorders. </em> </p>

        <h3>USES OF NEURALINK</h3>
        <em> <strong>BENEFITS  OF NEURALINK</strong>
          <li>Providing Paraplegics,Quadriplegics</li><li>Supervision</li><li>Treating paralysis </li><li>Memory loss</li><li>Immortality</li><br>
         <p>It can be used to operate encephalopathy. For Telepathy
          According to one of the lead chip designers at Neuralink, Telepathy can be the next frontier for Neuralink. He explained that it takes an incredible amount of effort to put thoughts into a set of words. These words are a compressed format of our immense thinking capabilities. Musk too, chimed in on this idea and added that the data rate of words is very low data and we’re putting a tremendous amount of mental energy into compressing the concepts and thoughts on our head into words. With Neuralink one might actually send the true thoughts and communicate far better. Musk called this communication a ‘non-linguistic consent consensual conceptual telepathy’.
